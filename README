QueryGeneratorforBIMserver0.2
=============================

The query generator generates the java query code automatically, and can be queried by bimserver.
This is the second release. The initial release url is: https://github.com/jjsahalf/BimServerQueryGenerator.

In this version, the GUI is changed a little bit. We also add more functionalities to run customized query on the basis of the information exchange requirement, which is represented in MVD or extended MVD. 
The objective of this version is to integrate BIM Datahub and OpenStudio that can potentially facilitate more effective information exchange among different simulation tools and platforms.

It contains the following steps to run the application and conduct various analyses using OpenStudio:
1. Users provide the Query Generator with the Information Exchange Requirement, which specifies the required data from BIMserver. 
2. The application generates the query code automatically.
3. Users open the generated query code, copy the content and paste it in the advanced query block of BIMserver.
4. BIMserver shows the queried result, and outputs the intermediate file for OpenStudio to conduct further analyses.
